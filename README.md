This is the Raspberry Pi component of a system that interfaces with the [Philips HUE Wireless Lighting](http://www.meethue.com) system to automatically turn on lights when motion is detected and luminosity is below a user defined threshold. The actual motion and luminosity sensor component can be found here: [Ar-Nova-5](https://github.com/projectweekend/Ar-Nova-5).
